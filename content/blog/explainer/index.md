This project began as a way to show that people didn't want to play on one specific position on 
Supreme Isthmus. *Did I discover anything?* Yes. I discovered the exact opposite.

In the end this project trurned into what it's now: a website to view statistics on maps and
positions. This article aims to explain the features, and more specifically, how to read charts.

Part 1: Generic charts
---
There are 3 generic charts that were created:
1. Faction pick/winrate.
1. Team winrate.
1. Os To time line charts.

**Faction pick/winrate** measures the number of times a person chose a faction 
and percentage of wins for a faction respectively. Usually, winrate should be the same for both factions
(For legion data might be a bit weird, because there are few people choosing it).

1. Faction winrate.
1. Faction preference.

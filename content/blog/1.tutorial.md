This project began as a way to show that people didn't want to play on one specific position on 
Supreme Isthmus. *Did I discover anything?* Yes. I discover the exact opposite.

In the end this project trurned into what it's now: a website to view statistics on maps and
positions. This article aims to explain the features, and more specifically, how to read charts.

Part 1: Generic charts
---
There are 3 generic bar charts that were created:
1. Faction winfactor.
1. Team winrate.
1. Average time to os.

**Faction winfactor** is a measure of importance of a faction on win or loss. 
For example, 




1. Faction winrate.
1. Faction preference.
